# Assessment_of_California-s_NO-_Pollution_Status_in_2020
This repository provides a complete data-driven workflow for assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) pollution across California in 2020 and exploring its relationship with large-scale wildfire activity. The year 2020 is a unique case study due to the coexistence of record-breaking wildfires and widespread COVID-19 lockdown measures, which together created complex and contrasting NO₂ emission dynamics.
